# The Tiger Cub 
first platformer game level: The Tiger Cub

Your mother has been gone for a lot longer than expected and its almost dinner time! 
It sounds easier to call her except you are a tiger cub living in a hostile Indian jungle filled with snakes, bats, crocodiles and poachers trying to catch you as their next prize! 
What are you going to do? 
Wait for your mother to come home extremely late or go out into the jungle to find her yourself? 
After all, you are the child of an apex predator. Who will be there to stop you?
