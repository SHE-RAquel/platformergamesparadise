First Platformer Game: The Tiger's Cub
You are waiting for your mom to get home for dinner but the sun is almost down. 
It would be easier to call her except you are a tiger cub living in the hostile Indian jungle. 
Snakes, bats, crocs, and poachers are outside of your den looking for trouble but your heart and your stomach is telling you something is wrong.
You are the of an apex predator. What could go wrong?
